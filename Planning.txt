Jacob - So from my understanding, we are looking towards making a web based hotspot analyzer?
This would require both a front end team and a back end team.

I would recommend that we split up into 1 front end and 2 back end.
This way one person works on the design and setup of the page that the viewer will see, and
the other 2 will work on the back end logic and pulling from specific API's and what not.

We still will probably have to do some research as a team before we dive into this, but
if we start planning what each of us are going to work on, we can better focus our efforts
on what we will individually need to work on.
